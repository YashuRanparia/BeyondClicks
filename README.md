# Project title and description

**Beyond Clicks: Seamless Powerpoint Interaction**

Our project aims to revolutionize traditional PowerPoint presentations by introducing gesture-based controls for slide navigation and content interaction. Additionally, we integrated a virtual whiteboard feature, which allows presenters to annotate and draw directly on presentation slides during live presentations. This innovative system enhances user engagement, improves accessibility, and modernizes the presentation experience, offering a versatile and interactive platform for delivering dynamic presentations.


# What does the project do?
The project creates a novel way to control PowerPoint presentations using hand gestures. Users by simply moving their hands, can switch slides, draw, and annotate directly on the slides in real time. This adds an exciting layer of interactivity to presentations, making them more engaging and memorable for audiences.

# Why is the project useful?
The project is useful because it offers a more intuitive and interactive way to deliver PowerPoint presentations. By enabling gesture-based controls and integrating a virtual whiteboard feature, it enhances user engagement, improves accessibility, and modernizes the presentation experience. This innovative approach makes presentations more dynamic, engaging, and effective in conveying information to audiences.
