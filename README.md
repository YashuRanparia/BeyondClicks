# Beyond Clicks

Our project aims to revolutionize traditional PowerPoint presentations by introducing gesture-based controls for slide navigation and content interaction. Additionally, we integrated a virtual whiteboard feature, which allows presenters to annotate and draw directly on presentation slides during live presentations. This innovative system enhances user engagement, improves accessibility, and modernizes the presentation experience, offering a versatile and interactive platform for delivering dynamic presentations.

## What does this Project do ?
The project creates a novel way to control PowerPoint presentations using hand gestures. Users by simply moving their hands, can switch slides, draw, and annotate directly on the slides in real time. This adds an exciting layer of interactivity to presentations, making them more engaging and memorable for audiences.
